# dotFrostybot
The aim of the project is to create a bot that can play Agar.io

Make sure to install both bot.user.js and launcher.user.js. If you don't mind having the code auto update itself though, you can simply get the loader.user.js without the other two.

#Honorable mention
There are other people working on bots, you can check the forks, as well as GamerLio's Github which uses genetic algorithms: https://github.com/leomwu/agario-bot
